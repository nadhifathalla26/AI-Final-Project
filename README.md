# AI-Final-Project
This repository is for Artificial Intellegence big project. In this project, we are going to classify some wine data into the two classes based on their attribute. This project is developed using K-Nearest Neighbor with some KNN function for the data classification. For the data preprocessing, we devide the data into the training and testing data, and then we only use some data attribute that we want, so we reduce some data attribute that not be used. After the research, we can see the accuracy of the data classification and get a very good accuracy value
